## Description

In this we are creating a contract named as BankApp so we are generating a code in which we are generating 6 functions and each of them is performing different function.

1st function :
 createAcc () - in which we are using require function which first checks if all the condition are met then it passes to the next statement and in this like if the condition is false then it means that the (user already have an account)

for 2nd function -
accountExists() - in this it sends or displays the message (true) to the user when the account exists there

for 3rd function -
deposit () - which is as Public and payable in this it updates the userAccount  with the message value

for 4th function - 
withdraw () - it's only work is to withdraw the amount if the certain conditions are true, like account should exist and amount to be deposited should be greator than 0.

for 5th function - 
accountBalance () - in this we check the account balance for the given address like who calls the contract and message sender

for 6th function - 
transferEther () - in this we transfer the Ether to the another account and update the balance of the contract and amount must be transfered like receiver.transfer(transferAmount)



## for Webpage
